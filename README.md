# Angular Book Study

This app is TypeScript version of the code from the book "Mastering Angular 2 Components" by Gion Kunz (c) 2016 Packt Publishing. I found this book contains very nice approach and some interesting snippets however its content has to be updated due to rapid Angular development between 2015-2017. As I am using Angular4 for some time I decided to give this book another chance in 2018 by applying my current knowledge to the concepts described there. It gives me a unique oportunity to go quickly through parts that are easy for me and stop for a minute at some interesting things I can compare and reconsider.

Apart of TypeScript another major difference is usage of [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests #notimplementedyet

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests #notimplementedyet

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
